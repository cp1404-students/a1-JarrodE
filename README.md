# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Song List 1.0

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: Jarrod Eaton

This program is a simple song list that allows a user to track songs that they wish to learn and
songs they have completed learning. The program reads and writes a list of songs in a file.

Users can choose to see the list of songs, which should be sorted by year then by title.
Users can add new songs and mark songs as learned.

I have 8 functions all up including main that completes the above tasks.

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

   > 6 1/2 days

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

   > Better preparation (doing more practice coding leading up to the assignment as I had to use the Programming
   > Patterns references a fair bit as well as review previous lectures and coding) and planning (Actually plan 
   > what days and what times to code instead of coding whenever I get a spare minute).
